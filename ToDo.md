/* 
    There is a lot of work to do in the future!

1- Launch the Notes app as a separate lightweight app.
2- Implement the desired Calendar View API to the Weekly Goals Record.
3- Add a Calendar that has events marked in specific days. Add a Calendar view of when Weekly Goals
were completed.
4- Have AI create a workout routine based on physical goals such as losing weight. Gaining muscle. 
Or even more. The user can create constraints such as only natural exercises. No legs workout, no 
cardio, or only weight lifting. If the user is able to complete excercices with the given weight 
easily then the AI increases weight for you.
5- Maybe have a different AI instead.
