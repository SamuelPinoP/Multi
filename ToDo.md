* Make sure the Note Widget has an Icon and a name Multi Notes could be the name.

* Sorting notes by alphabetical order or date or access.

1- The keyboard still covers some of the note. If I put the cursor in the bottom of the note the
keyboard doesn't adjust to not cover it until I type something. It should adjust right after I put
the cursor there.

4- Create a system that receives an intelligent command such as: Create event on Saturday 12. It
will be camping with my friends Josh and Mara. Then it will add camping trip as header. Description
given and the date given.

6- I want Mental Notes or Mind Notes.
By clicking a button that will look like a thought on a cloud, white or green cloud, the user
displays a different view for the notes.  The Mind View will be organized in a blank infinite space.
By holding down the cursor, we create a new note, it will give the option to create Notes and
connect them to one another. I get to see all my notes and how they connect. Also, give the option
to create a different Mind View. Which will be blank, and give the option to create more notes
there.  Extremely important to give Top-down notes. Notes that I can write on a block and extend.
Then put another note under. Like parent and child. They will look like blocks and the user gets to
organize them as he pleases, and also freely resize them. It will be precisely good for project
management.

7- Make sure July 4, Presidents Day. The super Bowl and every other event such as formula races or
any other marked famous date and relevant event is in the Calendar plus any additions. Boost the
feature of creating custom Events. So I make sure people enjoy their lives and use their time with
their families because that is the kind of app I would use.

- Architecture – Introducing ViewModel and repository layers for notes would better separate UI and
  data logic.

Failed tasks:
- Stopping the keyboard from covering part of the note. This is possible!
- Allowing the insertion of images in the notes. This is also possible!
