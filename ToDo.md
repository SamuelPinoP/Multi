    There is a lot of work to do now!

- Greatly improve the UI
- Allow to download the Notes in Word or PDF format
- Allow to share Notes to whatsap, gmail, and messenger
- Make sure every first letter is a mayus

0- The note opened last is always displayed first.
1- Implement the desired functionality for the Notes application.
2- Make sure the notes application can copy and paste columns and rows as desired and also add
highlighted text in different colors as well as adding divisions between lines and segments.
3- Add notifications for the Events we have.
4- Add feature of having a notification about daily activities. The user can click progress without 
entering the app. As a Remainder, only for active users.

5- Add Attach button in the events activity to attach notes to an specific event. It could be a new
note or an existing one or even multiple of them. I must select the event first and then the note.

/* 
    There is a lot of work to do in the future!

1- Launch the Notes app as a separate lightweight app.
2- Implement the desired Calendar View API to the Weekly Goals Record.
3- Add a Calendar that has events marked in specific days. Add a Calendar view of when Weekly Goals
were completed.
4- Have AI create a workout routine based on physical goals such as losing weight. Gaining muscle. 
Or even more. The user can create constraints such as only natural exercises. No legs workout, no 
cardio, or only weight lifting. If the user is able to complete excercices with the given weight 
easily then the AI increases weight for you.
5- Maybe have a different AI instead.
