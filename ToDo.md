There is a lot of work to do now!

Fix the Save button has been deleted from Weekly Goals. Bring it back.


I need to add levels of priority to the notes. Priority green. It is high. Yellow is medium. Red is
low. By clicking each of them we can display the notes with that priority.


I want the Events in Calendar button to bring a MaterialCalendarView. Every date when an event 
happens must be marked in green or choose a color for them. I want a button that says Weekly Goals 
View were every day when the user completed a Weekly goal will be marked. Also a Calendar regular 
view that contains the current implementation were the click in a date create an event with that 
date marked.

0- Whenever an event date is added it should be in the Calendar marking the day with the green color
if the user clicks the day with green color then every event in that day is displayed either in its
own database or in the events view of the events page.
1- The Workout page should have different workout plans. They should be added to the events page.
Maybe add options to customize the workout such as adding a specific workout of calestenics to the
day. Think it further. Or even more. The user can create constraints such as only natural exercises. 
No legs workout, no cardio, or only weight lifting.
2- Make sure the notes application can copy and paste columns and rows as desired and also add
highlighted text in different colors as well as adding divisions between lines and segments.
3- Add notifications for the Events we have.
4- Add feature of having a notification about daily activities. The user can click progress without
entering the app. As a Remainder, only for active users.

5- Add Attach button in the events activity to attach notes to an specific event. It could be a new
note or an existing one or even multiple of them. I must select the event first and then the note.

There is a lot of work to do in the future!

1- Launch the Notes app as a separate lightweight app.
2- Implement the desired Calendar View API to the Weekly Goals Record.
3- Add a Calendar that has events marked in specific days. Add a Calendar view of when Weekly Goals
were completed.
