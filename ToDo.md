There is a lot of work to do now!

-4- Make sure July 4, Presidents Day. The super Bowl and every other event such as formula races or 
any other marked famous date and relevant event is in the Calendar plus any additions. Boost the 
feature of creating custom Events. So I make sure people enjoy their lives and use their time with 
their families because that is the kind of app I would use.

-3- Improving UI of Events in Calendar. If I choose every tuesday, then I want every tuesday to be 
marked in the Calendar. 

-2- We need a Sort button for the events. To display the order of the events added or date when the
event happens.

-1-I need to add levels of priority to the notes. Priority green. It is high. Yellow is medium. Red 
is low. By clicking each of them we can display the notes with that priority.


0-I want a button that says Weekly Goals View were every day when the user completed a Weekly goal 
will be marked. 

1- The Workout page should have different workout plans. They should be added to the events page.
Maybe add options to customize the workout such as adding a specific workout of calestenics to the
day. Think it further. Or even more. The user can create constraints such as only natural exercises. 
No legs workout, no cardio, or only weight lifting.

2- Add highlighted text in different colors as well as adding divisions between lines and segments.

3- Add notifications for the Events we have.

4- Add feature of having a notification about daily activities. The user can click progress without
entering the app. As a Remainder, only for active users.

5- Add Attach button in the events activity to attach notes to an specific event. It could be a new
note or an existing one or even multiple of them. I must select the event first and then the note.

There is a lot of work to do in the future!

1- Launch the Notes app as a separate lightweight app.

2- Implement the desired Calendar View API to the Weekly Goals Record.
