* I need to create some kind of celebration animation whenever the user completes all his weekly
goals. Consider the embellishment of the UI in every screen.

* Putting Calendar first gives the wrong idea:
  Maybe putting the notes first would make it seem a notes application instead of a Calendar 
application. Also create the note widget. Put Calendar at the end like an addition to the app or 
content it has that the user has available. Calendar has three Calendars as I wanted to create it 
but it is less understandable.

* Icon:
  Multi and Tic Tac Toe need icons. I bet that is easy to do.

* Improving the design of the Calendar.
  The data the Calendar stores in each day could look better or be more interactive and fun. It 
definitely needs to be more beautiful than it is and have more modernity.

* Instead of adding page numbers add word count.
  If I cannot add a page number right now let's add a word count that displays the number of words 
in the note. So the user knows how long the note is by the amount of words.

* Maybe the amount of letters too in the notes.

* Update with safety backup
  When there is an update in the app the notes I created get deleted. It should not happen. Because 
the user will have to create the notes again and will lose a lot of work and all the info. I need to
be respectful of the user.

* Tic Tac Toe design and AI.
  Make the AI have two levels of difficulty. The Superium level is impossible to defeat. Virtually 
nobody can. If you find an algorithm to win. If you find a way to win you are probably a genius. 
Communicate that to the user.

* Security and no data leaks.
  I will not ask for your personal data. I will give you real private use of technology.

* Post both apps.
  Post Multi. Post Tic Tac Toe in the Play Store.

* Focus needs to update below the keyboard.
  It is possible and it will make a lot of difference.

1- Improve the design of the text that says Multi it is too simple add beauty and modernity.
2- The event created pop up is displayed above the Add Event and Calendar buttons.
3- Add a description that says: You can create an Event/ Weekly Goal the first time the user opens
the app. Like a tutorial. After the user has clicked the tutorial then it disappears. Put it in the
settings.
4- Make two different widgets for the Calendar (says when is the next event Date above and days
remaining under), the Notes (when clicked it opens the last note the user opened in the app, it 
includes the button of go to app where multi is opened).




----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Add Attach button in the events activity to attach notes to an specific event. It could be a new
note or an existing one or even multiple of them. I must select the event first and then the note.

- Add a remainders page that will allow to set alarms and remainders in specific days in the 
Calendar. 

- Maybe add alarms with whichever song I choose.

- I need to add levels of priority to the notes. Priority green. It is high. Yellow is medium. Red 
is low. By clicking each of them we can display the notes with that priority.

- Adding remainders and a todo tag in red to the note with red priority will make it somehow a todo 
item.

4- Add feature to the notification from weekly activities. The user can click progress without
entering the app. As a Remainder, only for active users.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1- The keyboard still covers some of the note. If I put the cursor in the bottom of the note the
keyboard doesn't adjust to not cover it until I type something. It should adjust right after I put
the cursor there.

//                          After publishing it do:

4- Create a system that receives an intelligent command such as: Create event on Saturday 12. It
will be camping with my friends Josh and Mara. Then it will add camping trip as header. Description
given and the date given.

5- Allow Voice Notes as notes in multi.

6- I want Mental Notes or Mind Notes.
By clicking a button that will look like a thought on a cloud, white or green cloud, the user
displays a different view for the notes.  The Mind View will be organized in a blank infinite space.
By holding down the cursor, we create a new note, it will give the option to create Notes and
connect them to one another. I get to see all my notes and how they connect. Also, give the option
to create a different Mind View. Which will be blank, and give the option to create more notes
there.  Extremely important to give Top-down notes. Notes that I can write on a block and extend.
Then put another note under. Like parent and child. They will look like blocks and the user gets to
organize them as he pleases, and also freely resize them. It will be precisely good for project
management.

7- Make sure July 4, Presidents Day. The super Bowl and every other event such as formula races or
any other marked famous date and relevant event is in the Calendar plus any additions. Boost the
feature of creating custom Events. So I make sure people enjoy their lives and use their time with
their families because that is the kind of app I would use.

- Architecture – Introducing ViewModel and repository layers for notes would better separate UI and
  data logic.

/* 
Failed tasks:
- Stopping the keyboard from covering part of the note. This is possible!
- Allowing the insertion of images in the notes. This is also possible!
