There is a lot of work to do now!

Now!!! I need to display the page number for each page in the Notes. I need to have the notes open 
in the exact page and point I close. If I was in the 5th page, second paragraph then when I reopen, 
I will be in the fifth page in that paragraph.

-24- Architecture – Introducing ViewModel and repository layers for notes would better separate UI 
and data logic.

-23- State restoration – Persist scroll position and cursor location so a note reopens exactly where 
it was closed. Bulk operations – The code currently handles only single-note share/delete; 
supporting multi-select would improve usability.

-22- The header should be a part of the first page.

-21- Add divisions among pages.

-20 Think about having a second view to the notes activity. The medallion will be the view during
night mode, or the user can change different views, from the current one to the medallion.

-19- Make notes able to add addresses and display google maps.

-18- Create a system that receives an intelligent command such as: Create event on Saturday 12. It
will be camping with my friends Josh and Mara. Then it will add camping trip as header. Description
given and the date given.

-17- Allow Voice Notes as notes in multi.

-16- Consider adding a new note button inside each note for users who might want to create a second
note while writing one. Create a go back button to go back to the previous not and a go forward to 
go to the next note.

-15- Delete everything 30 days old in the trash when the Notes Activity is opened instead of when
the trash is opened.

-14- Add dark and light theme

-13- Animation when or pic whenever the events are empty and there are no weekly activities. Instead
of just having a text no events, add a sleepy bear or something.

-12- Whenever I cut something it must be removed from the note asap. Currently when I cut something
the note still keeps it. If the note becomes empty when I cut the text then the note must be
automatically deleted.

-11- Make it so that the note can be shared as a text file too.

-10- I want the note to have a proper title when I share it. It will be shared with the name of the
first 2 words in the note as a title.

-9- I want Mental Notes or Mind Notes.
By clicking a button that will look like a thought on a cloud, white or green cloud, the user 
displays a different view for the notes.  The Mind View will be organized in a blank infinite space. 
By holding down the cursor, we create a new note, it will give the option to create Notes and 
connect them to one another. I get to see all my notes and how they connect. Also, give the option 
to create a different Mind View. Which will be blank, and give the option to create more notes 
there.  Extremely important to give Top-down notes. Notes that I can write on a block and extend. 
Then put another note under. Like parent and child. They will look like blocks and the user gets to 
organize them as he pleases, and also freely resize them. It will be precisely good for project 
management.


-6- I need to add the share button for PDF and Word next to trash and new note. The button must be
beautiful. I must be able to select several notes and share all of them and not just 1.

-5- Allow notes to have an address besides the date. The address will be in the note and display a
Google map in that address.

-4- Make sure July 4, Presidents Day. The super Bowl and every other event such as formula races or 
any other marked famous date and relevant event is in the Calendar plus any additions. Boost the 
feature of creating custom Events. So I make sure people enjoy their lives and use their time with 
their families because that is the kind of app I would use.

-3- Improving UI of Events in Calendar. If I choose every tuesday, then I want every tuesday to be 
marked in the Calendar. 

-2- We need a Sort button for the events. To display the order of the events added or date when the
event happens.

-1-I need to add levels of priority to the notes. Priority green. It is high. Yellow is medium. Red 
is low. By clicking each of them we can display the notes with that priority.


0-I want a button that says Weekly Goals View were every day when the user completed a Weekly goal 
will be marked. 

1- The Workout page should have different workout plans. They should be added to the events page.
Maybe add options to customize the workout such as adding a specific workout of calestenics to the
day. Think it further. Or even more. The user can create constraints such as only natural exercises. 
No legs workout, no cardio, or only weight lifting.

2- Add highlighted text in different colors as well as adding divisions between lines and segments.

3- Add notifications for the Events we have. Adding remainders and a todo tag in red to the note with
red priority will make it somehow a todo item.

4- Add feature of having a notification about daily activities. The user can click progress without
entering the app. As a Remainder, only for active users.

5- Add Attach button in the events activity to attach notes to an specific event. It could be a new
note or an existing one or even multiple of them. I must select the event first and then the note.

There is a lot of work to do in the future!

1- Launch the Notes app as a separate lightweight app.

2- Implement the desired Calendar View API to the Weekly Goals Record.
